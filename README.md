# Python-Fingerprint

Finding if fingerprints is of a person that have fingerprint already in the database. Using library for creating keypoints on image and comparing them with the keypoints of other image i managed to make the app compare the fingerprints. The app is not usable but still it was fun to make as my second python project.

The fingerprints for testing are given to be my university.
